  <center><p> My partner and I created a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide. The calculator can save your work and open it back up. We programmed in python and Tkinter. </p></center></div>

  <center><h2>Description</h2></center>
  <center><p>I present to you our RSA project created with Python using the Tkinter GUI. To send encrypted messages, you need to get a friend’s public key. These are your “n” and “e” values. To encrypt a message, start off by entering your “n” and “e” values into the program. Next, enter the message in the first text box on the left side. Finally, to encrypt it, click the encrypt button. Your message should now be a bunch of random characters that make no sense. Would you like to keep a record of this? To save your encrypted message, click on the encryption drop down menu and click save. This will create a new text document named after the “n” and “e” values you input into the program. If you close the program and would like to open that encrypted message you sent to that specific person. Enter the public key that you used to send the message. Then, go to the encryption drop down menu and click open. Your encrypted message should appear on the left-hand side. To decrypt a message, you will need the public key that’s embedded in the program for the “n” and “e” values. This will help decode the message you received from someone else. To decrypt, enter the program’s public key and then enter the encrypted message that you received from someone into the text box on the right-hand side. Then, click the decrypt button. This should turn the random characters into a readable message that you can understand. To save it, go under the decryption menu and click save. If you want to look at the history of your decrypted messages later on. Go to the decryption menu and click open. Your most recent decryption should appear on the right-hand side. </p></center></div>
