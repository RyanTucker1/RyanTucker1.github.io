			<p> This game we made is a game taken place mid battle agaisnt a witch you must defeat through RNG based combat, you select either to use your spells or melee attack by clicking the selected button, programming this mini game-esque battle was difficult in not for reasons that are just constant flaws and errors with the code, rather it was having to create multiple variables and damage calculation values to make it truly random, it originally was going to be a platforming or chase game, but It was decided near last minute hey, let's make it a turn based battle, that'll be fun. So we did. It took  both of us, Alexander Green and Ryan Tucker, to complete it to full extent while I created the sprites and the RNG code, he made the animations and general combat calculations equations.</p>

				<p> youre Anne Danke and this is your story, you have a very similar relation to the infamous Anne Frank. You live a similar life but more screwed up. theres multiple paths for the story to take and almost every decision matters. Death can be very quick. every other path (if theres alternates) will kill you and theres oly 1 true ending. You are trying to make it to the end and avoid getting spotted while keeping yourself entertained and surviving an abusive lover.</p>

			<div> <p>  (sorry for the ear rape in the video ive got a trash mic) not much to say abut this game, it was made to just have fun, some difficulties that were encountered by stupid things such like a missing quotation or something, really straight forward when you get the hang of functions, gotta give a shoutout to my partner Jason for story line, i generally did the endings and the code with some help with Jason, so it was in general a team effort, the game is essentially a unwinnable game, much like "emily is away" if you've heard of that, but this is simply history.. with some changes, soooo enjoy.!</p></div>not much to say about this game
